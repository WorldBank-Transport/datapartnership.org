On February 13, Data Collaboratives, for the first time, brought together International Consortium members, data partners, and staff working with these datasets in the field in one room. Nearly 200 colleagues joined the standing-room-only event, in person and online, learning about how private data partnerships can ethically and efficiency be made to work for public good.
