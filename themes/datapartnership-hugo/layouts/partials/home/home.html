            <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
              <p>Provision of public infrastructure and services is heavily dependent on data – higher quality, timely data translates into more effective project design, implementation, and evaluation. Traditional methods for public sector data collection can be inefficient – for example, in the transport sector, travel times are often estimated using stopwatches, and common origin-destination pairs are derived through decennial household surveys.</p>
              <p>Increasingly, the private sector is generating data that could be re-purposed to supplant traditional public-sector data collection methods – for example, using fleet GPS data to estimate speeds or mobile operator data to determine travel patterns.</p>
              <p>Rather than expend public resources collecting data that is already collected, the public sector should seek the comparative advantage of the private sector. In so doing, entirely new public good use cases could be discovered and implemented.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
              <p>There is a persistent market failure in the international development community between the supply of private sector data and the demand for its use.</p>
              <p>On the supply side, companies engaged in a range of businesses – e.g., ridesharing, social media, financial transactions, retail, shipping, mobile operators – generate data that can be repurposed for public good. However, since that “public good” may be in a sector outside the firm’s expertise, identifying an efficient public use would require intervention of a third party.</p>
              <p>On the demand side, companies are approached daily with data requests from academics, NGOs, governments, and international organizations. For mid-size and small companies especially, the burden of responding to this disaggregated demand can be overwhelming – processing requests, understanding needs, signing bilateral legal agreements, assigning technical staff to respond to questions, ensuring data security – all of which would be outside the scope of the company’s core business objectives.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
              <p>In practice, many companies are amenable to sharing data for public good, so long as: (a) the sharing would not compromise the company’s competitive advantage or the privacy of its customers; and (b) sharing would require no time or resources on their part.</p>
              <p>Since international organizations have similar aims and government counterparts, they are coordinating data sharing agreements through a new International Consortium for Data Collaboratives.</p>
