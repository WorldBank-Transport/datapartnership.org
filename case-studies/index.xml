      <description>Challenge: Kenya has one of the highest estimated crash fatality rates worldwide but is challenged to address the problem without adequate data.
Solution: Real-time access to Waze data helped identify patterns of traffic incidents and congestion.
Impact: A new method to better inform road safety interventions in Nairobi and similarly data-scarce environments.
The government of Kenya – from policy designers and implementers to regulators and enforcers – face a challenge: they know road crashes are a serious issue, particularly in the capital Nairobi.</description>
